A lion was once sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started running up and down his body just for fun. This disturbed the lion’s sleep, and he woke up quite angry. He was about to eat the mouse when the mouse desperately requested the lion to set him free. “I promise you, I will be of great help to you someday if you save me.” The lion laughed at the mouse’s confidence and let him go.
The next day, the lion was walking around the jungle when heard an eerie noise. This sound was strange, yet very familiar to the lion. As he cautiously navigated through the jungle to return to his pack, the lion spotted the mouse again. The mouse warned him, "Get out of here now. I told you I would be of great help, so trust me." But the lion laughed at the mouse's face and didn't acknowledge the its warning.
